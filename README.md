# Neural Image Caption Generation

Generating a textual description of an image is called image captioning. With the emergence of Neural Networks and higher computational power, the efforts to generate better captions for images have increased many folds. One simple approach to it is using a Convolution Neural Net- work(CNN) followed by Recurrent Neural Network(RNN). In this project, we extend the model by using RNN with attention over the image to im- prove the performance. We validate the use of attention with MS COCO dataset.
